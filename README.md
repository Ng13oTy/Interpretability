# Interpretability
This is for paper "Can Deep Learning Models Learn the Vulnerable Patterns for Vulnerability Detection?" It presents an experimental evaluation to investigate how the different deep learning models predict software vulnerability and if they have recognized the critical code segments representing the software vulnerability. With the help of our proposed framework, researchers understand the predicted results why the source code is considered as a vulnerable one more easily. We list the part of the labeled dataset (about CWE), the source code of our model and the related experiment results in this supplement. We also state that the entire dataset of this study will be available after it is published.

# code
The source code of the four models proposed in paper.

# data
See "data/README.md" to learn how we prepocess data.

# results
The specific experimental results of the four models towards the RQs in paper.
